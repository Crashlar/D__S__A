Tips-
     break all in single single terms 
     start printing with small terms 
     end..

     -Don't break the i , j structure if possible have you 

Summarize - 
     1. Square/ rectangle ka structure (i -> 1 to n   j -> 1 to n )
     2. Triangle 
          1. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to i 
          2. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to n + 1 - i 
          3. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to n - i 
               k ->  1 to i   
     3. Maths -> use brain power
