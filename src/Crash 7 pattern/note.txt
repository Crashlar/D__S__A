Tips-
     break all in single single terms 
     start printing with small terms 
     end..

     -Don't break the i , j structure if possible have you 

Summarize - 
     1. Square/ rectangle ka structure (i -> 1 to n   j -> 1 to n )
     2. Triangle 
          1. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to i 
          2. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to n + 1 - i 
          3. i -> 1 to n 
               j -> 1 to n - i 
               k ->  1 to i   
     3. Maths -> use brain power 

Common Pattern Categories : 
     Category	                  Example	                    Key Logic
     Rectangular	           ***** (5x5 square)	               Equal rows & columns
     Right-Angled	            * → *****	                    Stars = Row No. (i)
     Inverted	                 ***** → *	                    Stars = n - i
     Pyramid	               Centered triangle	               Spaces + Stars
     Diamond	               Pyramid + Inverted	               Split into 2 parts
     Number-Based	          1 22 333                      	Print row number
     Alphabet-Based	          A BB CCC	                         char('A' + i)


 Step-by-Step Approach :
     (1) Observe the Pattern
          Count rows, columns, spaces, and symbols.
          Check if it's growing/shrinking.

     (2) Find Row-Column Formula
          Relate i (row) and j (column) to the pattern.
          Example:
               Hollow Rectangle:
                    Print * only at borders (i==0, i==n-1, j==0, j==m-1).

     (3) Handle Spacing (if needed)
          Use cout << " "; before stars for pyramids/diamonds.

     (4) Test with Small n
          Verify logic for n=3 or n=4 before scaling.
