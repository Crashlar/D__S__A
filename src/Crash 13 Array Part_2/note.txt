Vector in C++
    replacement of array
    ploblem -
        array has fixed size 
        int arr[5] = { 1, 2 , 3,4,5}
        if i want to change the size then it is possible to go to change in our code 
    
    Vector is Dynamic array that change our size when required
    syntax- 
        vector<int> arr; 
    
    function in Vector -
        push_back -> intialize a value on the last box of vector 

        pop_back -> delete a back box value
        
        size ->how many box filled already
        
        capacity -> how many box in vector 
        
        at -> know exact position value

    
Passing Vectors to function : 
    vy value. Each time you pass , new vector is created if (&) is not passed to vector<int> v in function 

    vector<int> &v 
        this is point to same reference so the value is change in main function and not created new
