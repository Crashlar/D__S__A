QUESTION - 
    In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:

    When the array is sorted in increasing order
    When the array is sorted partially
    When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
    When the array is nearly sorted.

Ans - 
    Array is already sorted in increasing order 
    In this case, no swaps are needed, and bubble sort will complete in just one pass.
    It optimizes by detecting no swaps and stops early.
    Best-case time complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) (just one pass through the array).
