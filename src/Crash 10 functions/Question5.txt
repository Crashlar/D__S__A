Soln- 
    Minimum number of functions in any C++ program = 1 (just main())

Why not the other options?
    0 functions:
        ❌ Invalid — a C++ program without a main() function cannot run.

    2 functions:
        ❌ Not minimum — you can have more, but not necessary.

    Infinite functions:
        ❌ Makes no sense logically — a program can have many, but there's no rule forcing infinity.

```code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    return 0;
}

```

    // The minimum number of functions present in any C++ program is:

    // 0
    // 1
    // 2
    // Infinite
