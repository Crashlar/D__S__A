A function may be called more than once from any other function
    True

        Why?
            In C++, a function can be called multiple times from another function, including main() or any user-defined function. This is known as reusability, which is one of the main advantages of using functions.

            ```code 
            void greet() {
                cout << "Hello!" << endl;
            }

            int main() {
                greet(); // 1st call
                greet(); // 2nd call
                return 0;
            }

            ```
It is necessary for a function to return some value"
     False

        Why?
            In C++, it is NOT necessary for a function to return a value. If you don't want to return anything, you can use the void return type.

            ``` code
            void sayHi() {
                cout << "Hi there!" << endl;
            }
            This function does not return anything — and that’s totally valid.
            ```


// State True and False:

// A function may be called more than once from any other function
// It is necessary for a function to return some value.
