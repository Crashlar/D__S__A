2D Vectors

    vector<vector<int> > v;
    vector<vector<int> > v(m);  
        m is size
    vector<vector<int> > v(m , vector<int> (n));
        m is rows
        n is cols
    vector<vector<int> > v(m , vector<int> (n , k ));
        m is rows
        n is cols
        k is value in each box 

Advantages of vectors over arrays
    1. Increase your rows
    2. Variable Columns

    only possible in vector in box intialization

Vector-
    2D Vector are vector of vector

Advantages of Vector- 
    Passing of 2D arrays into Functions -> Problem 
        Soln = We have to mention rows and cols every time


Basic STL Functions in Vector
    push_back()
    pop_back()
    begin()
    end()
    rbegin()
    rend()
