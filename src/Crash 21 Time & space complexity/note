Notation for Differnt types of Time Complexity 

    Big O Notation 
        O(n)
            O(n+ k ) is = O(n)
            always takes the highest power 
        O(n^2)
        O(logn)
        O(2^n)
        O(1)
        Where n is usually size of array / data structure 

Space Complexity
    - Study of all extra space used in terms of given 'm' , 'n'
    O(1)
        constants 
    O(n+m)
    O(n*m)
