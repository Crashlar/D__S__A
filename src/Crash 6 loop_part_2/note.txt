    stop when the condtion true 
    A break statement is used when we want to terminate the running loop whenever any particular condition occurs. Whenever a break statement occurs loop breaks and stops executing.
    The Break statement is used to exit from the loop constructs.
    The break statement is usually used with the switch statement, and it can also use it within the while loop, do-while loop, or the for-loop.
    When a break statement is encountered then the control is exited from the loop construct immediately.
    Break statements uses switch and label statements.
    Leftover iterations are not executed after the break statement.


Continue 
    Syntax
        continue;
    is used when we have to skip a particular iteration. Whenever we write continue statement the whole code after that statement is skipped and loop will go for next iteration.
    The continue statement is not used to exit from the loop constructs.
    The continue statement is not used with the switch statement, but it can be used within the while loop, do-while loop, or for-loop.
    When the continue statement is encountered then the control automatically passed to the beginning of the loop statement.
    label statements.	It does not use switch and label statements.
    Leftover iterations can be executed even if the continue keyword appears in a loop.
