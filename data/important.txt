Title: 🚀 Getting Started with C++: Basics

---

C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language known for its power, speed, and flexibility. Whether you're aiming for system-level programming, game development, or high-performance applications, C++ is a great foundation.

This guide will help you understand the **basic concepts** of C++.

---

📌 1. What is C++?

C++ is a compiled, statically typed language that supports both **procedural** and **object-oriented** programming. It was developed as an extension of the C language.

---

📥 2. Structure of a Basic C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input/output stream.
- `using namespace std`: Avoids the need to prefix with `std::`.
- `int main()`: Entry point of the program.
- `cout`: Used to print output to the console.
- `return 0`: Indicates successful program termination.

---

📚 3. Data Types in C++

Commonly used data types:

- `int`: Integer (e.g., 10)
- `float`: Floating-point number (e.g., 10.5)
- `char`: Character (e.g., 'A')
- `bool`: Boolean (true/false)
- `string`: Sequence of characters (needs `#include <string>`)

---

🧮 4. Variables and Constants

```cpp
int age = 25;
const float PI = 3.14;
```

- Variables can be updated.
- Constants use the `const` keyword and cannot be changed after initialization.

---

🎯 5. Input and Output

```cpp
int x;
cin >> x;           // Takes input
cout << x << endl;  // Prints output
```

Use `getline(cin, str)` for reading full lines (including spaces).

---

🔁 6. Conditional Statements

```cpp
if (x > 0) {
    cout << "Positive";
} else {
    cout << "Non-positive";
}
```

Also supports `else if` and `switch-case`.

---

🔁 7. Loops

**While loop:**
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    cout << i;
    i++;
}
```

**For loop:**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << i;
}
```

**Do-while loop:**
```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
    cout << i;
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

---

📦 8. Functions

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Functions help in code reusability and modularity.

---

🧱 9. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

C++ supports classes and objects:

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    void start() {
        cout << "Car started";
    }
};
```

---

✅ 10. Compile and Run

To compile a program:
```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

---

Title: 🧠 Mastering Conditional Statements in C++

---

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on logic or input.
They form the foundation of control flow in any C++ program.

---

📌 1. The if Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is true.

```cpp
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5";
}
```

---

📌 2. The if-else Statement

When you need a fallback condition.

```cpp
if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5";
} else {
    cout << "x is 5 or less";
}
```

---

📌 3. else-if Ladder

Used to check multiple conditions.

```cpp
if (x > 10) {
    cout << "x is greater than 10";
} else if (x == 10) {
    cout << "x is exactly 10";
} else {
    cout << "x is less than 10";
}
```

---

📌 4. Nested if

You can put an `if` inside another `if`.

```cpp
if (x > 0) {
    if (x < 100) {
        cout << "x is a positive number less than 100";
    }
}
```

---

📌 5. The switch Statement

Used for fixed values.

```cpp
int day = 3;
switch(day) {
    case 1: cout << "Monday"; break;
    case 2: cout << "Tuesday"; break;
    case 3: cout << "Wednesday"; break;
    default: cout << "Another day";
}
```

---

⚠️ Notes:
- Always use `break;` in switch cases to avoid fall-through.
- Use `else if` when ranges or complex conditions are involved.
- `if` supports logical operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!`.


Title: 🔁 Understanding Loops in C++: Syntax and Explanation

---

## 🔁 Loops in C++: Syntax and Explanation

### 1. **For Loop**

The `for` loop is used when you know beforehand how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

#### **Syntax:**

```cpp
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization**: Initializes a loop counter.
- **Condition**: Checks if the loop should continue. If `true`, the loop executes.
- **Increment/Decrement**: Updates the counter after each loop iteration.

#### **Example:**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

- **Explanation**: This loop prints numbers from 0 to 4. `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 after each iteration until it is no longer less than 5.

---

### 2. **While Loop**

The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition is `true`.

#### **Syntax:**

```cpp
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

- **Condition**: This is evaluated before each iteration. If `true`, the loop continues.

#### **Example:**

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

- **Explanation**: This loop also prints numbers from 0 to 4. The condition is checked before every iteration.

---

### 3. **Do-While Loop**

The `do-while` loop ensures that the block of code is executed **at least once**, even if the condition is false from the beginning.

#### **Syntax:**

```cpp
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

- **Condition**: Checked after the loop body is executed.

#### **Example:**

```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

- **Explanation**: Similar to the `while` loop, this also prints numbers from 0 to 4, but guarantees one iteration, even if `i` starts at 5.

---

### **Key Differences:**

| Loop Type        | When to Use                          | Condition Check   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **For Loop**     | Known number of iterations           | Before iteration  |
| **While Loop**   | Unknown number of iterations         | Before iteration  |
| **Do-While Loop**| At least one iteration, then check   | After iteration   |

---

Loops are essential for repetition tasks and can significantly improve the efficiency of your C++ programs. Make sure to choose the appropriate loop based on your needs.
