We will acknowledge your email within **5‚Äì7 business days** and aim to investigate and resolve the issue promptly.

## Scope

This project consists of C++ code for learning DSA topics such as arrays, sorting, searching, trees, graphs, etc. It is **not intended for production use**, and:
- Has no external dependencies
- Does not run as a network service or application
- Does not store or process personal data

Therefore, the attack surface is minimal, but best practices are still encouraged.
